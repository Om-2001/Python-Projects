# Calculator App using Tkinter

## 1. Summarize code in short:
This code is an implementation of a simple calculator application using Tkinter, a Python GUI library. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations. It has a graphical user interface with buttons for digits, operators, parentheses, decimal point, clear, and an equals button to evaluate the expression.

## 2. Requirements:
To run this calculator application, you need to have Python installed on your system. The code utilizes the Tkinter library, which is usually included in the standard Python distribution.

## 3. Functionalities:
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Parentheses for grouping expressions.
- Percentage calculations.
- Clear button to reset the calculator.
- Equals button to evaluate the expression.

## 4. Limitations:
- The calculator doesn't handle complex expressions or order of operations.
- It may not provide error handling for invalid inputs.
- Floating-point precision limitations may result in slight inaccuracies in the results.

### Additional Points:
- The calculator uses a single entry field to display and input expressions.
- Buttons are designed with different colors to represent different functionalities.
- The calculator has a fixed window size and doesn't support resizing.
- The code uses lambda functions to bind button clicks to appropriate functions.
- The evaluation of expressions is done using Python's `eval` function, which may have security implications if used in an uncontrolled environment.
